# Connect4-
Connect 4 is a famous game on a 6 x 7 board and the goal of the game is to match 4 pieces of your color either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game will use NumPy array data and Pygame's module surfarray to give the illusion and animation of choosing which column to place the piece on.
